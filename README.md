## haiku_probe
Tools for probing/intervening on forward passes on Haiku models through the use of Nested ContextManagers.

Also implement a number of helpful wrappers for Haiku which facilitate:
 - Local and remote (via wandb) logging
 - Straight forward model initialization
 - Parameter loading and checkpointing
